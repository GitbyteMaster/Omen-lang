<b>So, what makes it any different from any other programming language?</b>

Unlike most programming languages, Omen's system is intended to understand the context of your code instead of you having to explain it to your interpreter with complex syntax.
> Hello World!
```java
// Java
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("hello world!");
  }
}
```
```rust
// Rust
fn main(){
  println!("hello world!");
}
```
```shell
# Omen
"hello world!"
```
